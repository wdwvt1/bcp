This folder contains drinking event data from 05/06/2016. Recording started at sample 11900, at computer system time 18:09:52. Based on previous work with the system, the sample number aligns better with filming time than computer system time. 

The annotations of the pictures in classifications.txt are frame start and frame end of an event. The codes are:
e - eating
d - drinking
iw - interacting with water 

iw was not recorded consistently; it would have raised the time to annotate substantially and unsure how valuable the output will be.

To verify that the annotations were correct, we compared them with the behavioral traces.
